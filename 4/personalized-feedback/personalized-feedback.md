## ðŸš€ Hey Builders,

First off, amazing work on your PoS submissions â€” every project, whether early-stage or more advanced, brings something exciting to the table. Just a few quick reminders and encouragements to help you keep leveling up:

### ðŸ”„ Keep Things Updated
- **Update your video** every time you add new functionality â€” this isnâ€™t just for the judges, itâ€™s great training for yourself. Show off your progress.
- **Update your deck** to match your latest build and clarify your narrative. A good story makes your tech more powerful.
- Make sure **smart contracts and repositories are correctly connected** to KarmaGAP. This boosts your visibility and gives reviewers confidence in your projectâ€™s depth.

### ðŸ¤– On Using AI
- If you're using AI tools (for slides, docs, UI, etc.), that's awesome â€” just **review the output**. Itâ€™s your vision; make sure the tech reflects it.
- **Less is more.** Focusing on **one or two core features and making them work beautifully** is more impressive than shipping a broken UI full of potential. Quality > vibe-coded quantity.

Now, onto your personalized feedback. Each note below is tailored to your project, with love and belief in your potential. Letâ€™s build.

## 3 Wheeler Bike Club

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/3-wheeler-bike-club)

**Current State:**

- You're already working with real communities and generating on-chain impact â€” thatâ€™s powerful. The mission is strong and the traction is visible.

**Letâ€™s Level Up:**

- Youâ€™ve got a bunch of repos now â€” simplify that for others (and future you). Maybe consolidate, or at least document whatâ€™s where.
- Self integration isnâ€™t mentioned â€” thatâ€™s a great way to build trust. Include it to make the flow more complete.
- Farcaster integration for bike investment is still unclear. Think about how you can streamline this experience.
- This feels like a strong Stage 1/2 project â€” with a few UX improvements and clearer flows, youâ€™ll be in great shape.

**Current State:**

- Youâ€™ve built a clean, functioning Farcaster mini app with a slick mobile UI. Thatâ€™s not easy â€” well done.

**Letâ€™s Level Up:**

- Self proof didnâ€™t work yet â€” take a moment to debug or clarify the flow.
- This project is super promising. Keep polishing it, adding real-world use cases and stability. You're building something strong.

## AfriCycle

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/africycle)

**Current State:**

- Youâ€™ve got a clean presentation and UI, but itâ€™s clear that some parts (like mentioned libraries) aren't implemented yet.

**Letâ€™s Level Up:**

- No on-chain activity yet? Letâ€™s change that! Even a single transaction proves real Web3 intent.
- Your codebase looks a bit boilerplate-heavy â€” show us your custom sauce.
- Onboarding is confusing after wallet connect. A quick tooltip or modal could do wonders.
- Clarify what's happening on-chain vs off-chain. A diagram or section in the README would help.
- The UI is crisp â€” now bring that same polish to the UX.

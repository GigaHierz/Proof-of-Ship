## ðŸš€ Hey Builders,

First off, amazing work on your PoS submissions â€” every project, whether early-stage or more advanced, brings us a lot of joy to review. Just a few quick reminders and encouragements to help you keep leveling up:

### ðŸ”„ General Completeness of Submission
- **Update your video** every time you add new functionality â€” this isnâ€™t just for the judges, itâ€™s great training for yourself. Show off your progress.
- **Update your deck** to match your latest build and clarify your narrative. A good story makes your tech more powerful. A good founder works constantly on improving their deck!!
- **Update your README** to match the information on KarmaGAP. This will be used by the agent to compare the techincal implementations and you want it to be up to date to get the best score possible. Discrepancies between README and technical implementation lead to loss of points. 
- Make sure **smart contracts and repositories are correctly connected** to KarmaGAP. This is the data we are using to evaluate your project. If it's not connected, it won't count into your score!

### Presentation IRL and in the video

Please remember that your presentation is the most important thing of your project. This is what people see. So, please follow the guide provided

- Time distribution
  - **1 min** intro to the idea, please use a deck or graphics or something visually pleasing. People have a short attention span and when you just talk over the startscreen of your dap, you loose them. Add highlights of the updates of the month
  - **2 min** walkthrough. Please pre-record and don't do a live demo. Add a voice over, but please with your own voice and not with AI. 
  - **1 min** roadmap, team, challenges, architecture. Create a personal relationship to the viewer.
- Practice your live presentation. Imagine the founders of Celo are watching this and probably a VC. Make sure you stand out. 
- Make sure your tech works. Invest in a better mic and check your recording afterwards for quality. In the end your online communication counts a lot and if people don't understand you, they won't be able to see your fill potential. 
- If you are using AI generated slides, please make sure to check them. I saw so many references to tech that was not in fact used. Don't overload your presentation with AI generated content, it will be too much. 
- Please make sure you don't have too much text on the slides. You will loose the judge and not manage to fully present your idea.

### ðŸ¤– On Using AI
- If you're using AI tools (for slides, docs, UI, etc.), that's awesome â€” just **review the output**. Itâ€™s your vision; make sure the tech reflects it.
- **Less is more.** Focusing on **one or two core features and making them work beautifully** is more impressive than shipping a broken UI full of potential. Quality > vibe-coded quantity.

Now, onto your personalized feedback. Each note below is tailored to your project, with love and belief in your potential. Letâ€™s build.

## 3 Wheeler Bike Club

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/3-wheeler-bike-club)

**Current State:**

- You're already working with real communities and generating on-chain impact â€” thatâ€™s powerful. The mission is strong and the traction is visible.

**Letâ€™s Level Up:**

- Youâ€™ve got a bunch of repos now â€” simplify that for others (and future you). Maybe consolidate, or at least document whatâ€™s where.
- Self integration isnâ€™t mentioned â€” thatâ€™s a great way to build trust. Include it to make the flow more complete.
- Farcaster integration for bike investment is still unclear. Think about how you can streamline this experience.
- This feels like a strong Stage 1/2 project â€” with a few UX improvements and clearer flows, youâ€™ll be in great shape.

## Ads-Bazaar

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/ads-bazaar)

**Current State:**

- Youâ€™ve built a clean, functioning Farcaster mini app with a slick mobile UI. Thatâ€™s not easy â€” well done.

**Letâ€™s Level Up:**

- Self proof didnâ€™t work yet â€” take a moment to debug or clarify the flow.
- This project is super promising. Keep polishing it, adding real-world use cases and stability. You're building something strong.

## AfriCycle

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/africycle)

**Current State:**

- Youâ€™ve got a clean presentation and UI, but itâ€™s clear that some parts (like mentioned libraries) aren't implemented yet.

**Letâ€™s Level Up:**

- No on-chain activity yet? Letâ€™s change that! Even a single transaction proves real Web3 intent.
- Your codebase looks a bit boilerplate-heavy â€” show us your custom sauce.
- Onboarding is confusing after wallet connect. A quick tooltip or modal could do wonders.
- Clarify what's happening on-chain vs off-chain. A diagram or section in the README would help.
- The UI is crisp â€” now bring that same polish to the UX.

## SubPay

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/subpay)

**What to Improve:**

- For testing and demos, avoid using placeholder text like "test." Instead, use realistic examples that illustrate the subscription model more clearly.
- Please don’t conduct live walkthroughs of your dApp. Pre-record your demo and talk over it — this ensures a smoother and more coherent explanation of the product.
- The demo video should clearly explain the product’s purpose, functionality, and value proposition from end to end.
- The slides appear to be AI-generated, which is fine — but they need thorough review and refinement to ensure accuracy and clarity.
- Your slides mention using `ethers.js` and the "Celo SDK," but there is no official Celo SDK, and using `ethers.js` is not the recommended approach. Please update the technical stack details to reflect what you're actually using.
- It’s great to see that you’ve applied previous feedback — there’s clear improvement in the UI and UX.
- However, it’s still not clear exactly what the product is offering. The slides should be reworked to clearly communicate the core value proposition.
- Improve the visual design of the slides — right now they are mostly text. Include a competitor analysis table and some diagrams or graphics to communicate your model more effectively.
- While the user experience and UI are improving, there are no working on-chain interactions yet. Integrating this is essential for demonstrating functionality and value.
- The use case and business model are interesting and worth exploring further, but the project still needs additional development to reach a more complete state.

- There is no video or presentation included, which makes it difficult to understand how the app works.
- Despite that, the app appears close to production-ready based on its interface and presentation.

**What to Improve:**

- The user interface is nicely designed — great work there.
- However, the app is only available for Android, which limits accessibility for testers and users on other platforms.
- Without a demo video or accessible build, I wasn’t able to test the app. Providing both would significantly improve the evaluation experience.

[View on KarmaGAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/yapbay-p2p-stablecoin-remittances)

**Current State:**

- The project has strong potential and would be even more impactful with a simpler user interface.
- It’s great to see supporting blog posts and a live MVP available on your site — this shows commitment and progress.

**What to Improve:**

- The interface still presents too much information at once — simplifying the layout would improve usability.
- While instructions for testing are clear, the onboarding flow could be refined further to enhance user experience.
- The use case is highly relevant, especially for onboarding users in Latin America — this regional focus is appreciated and valuable.
- The interface is intuitive in parts, but still needs refinement to achieve a more seamless experience.
- The live demo currently lacks on-chain interactions. Integrating these is essential to demonstrate full functionality.
